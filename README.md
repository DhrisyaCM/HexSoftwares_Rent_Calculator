How It Works
Input Variables:

base_rent: The base rent for your place.
utilities: The monthly cost of utilities (e.g., electricity, water, gas).
internet: The monthly cost of internet services.
other_expenses: Any other expenses (e.g., maintenance, parking fees, etc.).
Calculation: The script adds up all the entered costs to give the total monthly rent.

Output: The script prints the total rent, formatted to two decimal places for readability.
